## Objectives

* Students will explore CSS Flexbox and Grid in two code alongs

### Key Student Take-Aways

* Students should have an understanding of how to organize web page content using either flex or grid
* Students should understand that it is possible, with a minimal amount of CSS properties, it is possible to allow the web browser to handle dynamic displaying of content, preventing web designers from having to create extensive, granularly detailed CSS classes

### Caveats

* There are only two code-alongs on this day, so some students may finish early.  It may be good to have some review tasks ready for these students while others are still completing the lessons.  Encourage students to practice combining CSS flexbox and/or grid with @media queries - for instance, can students create a grid of images on a larger screen that turns into a scrollable list of flexbox items on mobile?
* If all or most students complete these lessons early, it may be good to deploy the readme for the upcoming HTML/CSS project.  Since this is a project, giving students additional time will only benefit them and should allow them to produce more detailed/advanced brochure sites
